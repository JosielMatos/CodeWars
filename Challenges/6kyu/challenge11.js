// Disgruntled Employee

// Sir Bobsworth is a custodian at a local data center. As he suspected,
// Bobsworth recently found out he is to be fired on his birthday after years
// of pouring his soul into maintaining the facility.

// Bobsworth, however, has other plans.

// Bobsworth knows there are 1 to n switches in the breaker box of the data center.
// Moving from switch 1 to n, Bob first flips every switch off. Beginning from the first
// switch again, Bob then flips every 2nd switch. Once again starting from the first switch,
// Bob then flips every 3rd switch. Bob continues this pattern until he flips every nth switch & makes n passes.

// At the end of Bobsworth's mayhem, how many switches are turned off?

// Specifications
// Create the function off, that receives the nth switch as argument n. The function
// should return an ascending array containing all of the switch numbers that
// remain off after Bob completes his revenge.

// off (1) //returns {1}
// off (2) //returns {1}
// off (4) //returns {1,4}
// off (9) //returns {1,4,9}
// off(1) # returns [1]
// off(2) # returns [1]
// off(4) # returns [1, 4]
// The parameter n will always be a number >= 1.

function off(n) {
  let count = 1;
  let arr = [];
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i += count) {
    arr.push(i);
    count += 2;
  }
  return arr;
}
