// Death Star Construction

// Story
// The construction of the new Death Star is almost complete.
// It only needs a certain amount of 3 materials â€“ iron, steel, and chromium.
// The emperor wants the construction finished within a week because he senses
// an impending rebel attack and knows the battle station will be destroyed if
// it is not completed within this timeframe. He has already ordered enough
// material delivered to the station within a week. The problem is, the rebels
// are attacking the supply routes and there are different amounts of material
// arriving at the station each week. Will the station be ready in time or will it be destroyed?

// Task
// The required resources are:

// 100 Gt of iron
// 75 Gt of steel
// 50 Gt of chromium
// The input will consist of an array with 8 elements:

// The first 7 elements are the shipments - 3-elements-long arrays where each number
// corresponds to the amount of material that was ordered (iron, steel, and chromium)
// The last element is a number representing the day of the rebel
// attack (0-indexed) - any materials which should have been delivered that day will
// be lost, and later shipments will be cancelled due to the trading route becoming unsafe
// The output will be one of the two possible string:

// In case enough resources were delivered before the attack, return "The station is completed!"
// Otherwise, return "The station is destroyed! It needed X iron, Y steel and Z chromium for completion.",
// where X, Y and Z are the quantities of the respective material

function deathStar(week) {
  const resources = week.slice(0, week[7]);
  const delivered = resources.reduce((a, c) => [
    a[0] + c[0],
    a[1] + c[1],
    a[2] + c[2],
  ]);
  const nIron = delivered[0] >= 100 ? 0 : 100 - delivered[0];
  const nSteel = delivered[1] >= 75 ? 0 : 75 - delivered[1];
  const nChromium = delivered[2] >= 50 ? 0 : 50 - delivered[2];

  return delivered[0] >= 100 && delivered[1] >= 75 && delivered[2] >= 50
    ? "The station is completed!"
    : `The station is destroyed! It needed ${nIron} iron, ${nSteel} steel and ${nChromium} chromium for completion.`;
}
